    <p>
      Te Waimāpihi, also known as the Waimapihi or Te Aro Stream, is a buried waterway in Wellington, New Zealand,
      originating from the bush reserve of Waimapihi and running beneath the city to Wellington Harbour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Historically, it was a vital freshwater and food source for Māori communities, particularly connected to the ancestress Māpihi, after whom the stream is named.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stream was buried in the late 1800s to support urban development. Though hidden, it continues to flow in culverts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Efforts to restore its cultural and ecological presence include a Garrett Street mural honoring Māpihi and art installations such as Te Aro Park, which echoes the stream’s memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      Community groups like the Polhill Protectors have helped replant its upper catchment, while scientific studies using eDNA confirm life still persists in its waters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Waimapihi’s story is one of resilience, cultural reawakening, and ecological memory in the heart of a modern city.
