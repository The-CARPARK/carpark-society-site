      <h1>Level 5 – Te Waimāpihi</h1>
      <p>Te Waimāpihi (Waimapihi Stream or Te Aro Stream) is a buried awa that once flowed freely through central Wellington. Named after Māpihi, a revered wahine rangatira, this stream was a lifeline for Māori communities pre-colonisation.</p>
      <p>From its origins in what is now Waimapihi Reserve, it traveled through Aro Valley and Te Aro, supporting mahinga kai and ritual bathing. With European colonisation, it was culverted and renamed Te Aro Stream, eventually becoming part of the city’s hidden stormwater network.</p>
      <p>Modern restoration efforts like Te Aro Park and murals on Garrett Street celebrate the stream’s cultural memory. Polhill Protectors and mana whenua groups continue ecological work to restore native species and advocate for the stream’s recognition.</p>
      <p>The stream’s voice can still be heard—beneath manholes, in mural patterning, and during the city’s night rains. The stream lives on in mauri, story, and ceremony, even as its course runs below concrete feet.</p>
