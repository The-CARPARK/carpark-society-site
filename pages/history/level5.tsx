      <p>This level reveals the story of Te Waimāpihi (Waimapihi Stream), a buried freshwater awa beneath Wellington. Highlights include:</p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mt-2">
        <li><strong>Cultural Legacy:</strong> Named after Māpihi, a wahine rangatira, the stream was a taonga for Māori communities in the Te Aro region.</li>
        <li><strong>Colonial Impacts:</strong> The stream was gradually culverted and buried under roads and buildings throughout the 19th century.</li>
        <li><strong>Revival Efforts:</strong> Te Aro Park, Garrett Street mural, and sculptures commemorate the awa, bringing it back into public memory.</li>
        <li><strong>Environmental Restoration:</strong> The Polhill Protectors and mana whenua are working to restore the stream's upper catchment.</li>
        <li><strong>Ongoing Presence:</strong> Though hidden, Te Waimāpihi still flows under the city and supports aquatic life. Citizens now seek to daylight its course and honour its mauri.</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mt-4">For the Watchers, Te Waimāpihi represents a sacred thread weaving past, present, and future—a whisper beneath the concrete, calling us to remember.</p>
