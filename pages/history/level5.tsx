      <p>
        Te Waimāpihi, or the Waimapihi Stream, once flowed freely through Aro Valley and Te Aro into the harbour. It was named after the ancestress Māpihi, who is remembered for bathing in its waters, sanctifying the stream in Māori tradition. This awa was a vital mahinga kai, providing kai like tuna (eels) and kōura (crayfish), and linking many iwi through whakapapa.

        As Wellington urbanised, the stream was culverted beginning in the late 1800s. By the 20th century, it was fully underground, its waters redirected through brick and concrete tunnels, now part of the city’s stormwater system. Despite being hidden, Waimapihi retains cultural significance. The Garrett Street mural and Te Aro Park’s water features symbolically revive its presence, honoring both natural and ancestral legacies.

        In recent years, community and mana whenua initiatives—like the Waimapihi Nature Reserve and Polhill Protectors—have worked to restore the stream’s ecology and mana. eDNA sampling confirms the stream still supports native aquatic life. Conservation and public art are reawakening the stream’s identity, reminding Wellingtonians of the hidden awa that flows beneath them.
