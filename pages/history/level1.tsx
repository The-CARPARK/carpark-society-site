			The Foundation: Te Aro Pā and the Struggle for Whenua

 Remains of Te Aro Pā are preserved under glass at a central Wellington site, providing a tangible link to the ancestral whenua.

Long before colonial roads and buildings covered central Wellington, the area of Te Aro was home to a thriving Māori settlement, Te Aro Pā. Established in the 1820s by iwi (tribes) including Te Āti Awa who migrated from Taranaki, Te Aro Pā grew to be one of the largest pā (villages) in the region. By the 1840s it spanned an estimated 40–60 acres and housed extensive whare (houses) and gardens, sustaining a vibrant community. For its inhabitants, the surrounding whenua (land) and moana (harbor sea) were not just resources but sacred kin. In the Māori worldview, land is imbued with mauri (life force) and regarded as an ancestor (Papatūānuku, the earth mother). Tellingly, the word whenua means both “land” and “placenta” in te reo Māori, reflecting the belief that people are born of the land and remain spiritually tethered to it. Likewise, the sea (moana) is part of this living cosmos, under the guardianship of Tangaroa (deity of the ocean), and integral to identity and sustenance. This deep cultural and spiritual connection meant that Te Aro’s Māori residents saw themselves as kaitiaki (guardians) of the land and waters—they belonged to the land as much as it belonged to them.

The arrival of British colonists in 1839–40 set the stage for a profound struggle over whenua. The New Zealand Company, led by Colonel William Wakefield, claimed to have purchased the Te Aro area in 1839 as part of the Port Nicholson deed, but this transaction was dubious at best. It was negotiated with two chiefs from outside Te Aro (Te Puni of Pito-one and Te Wharepōuri of Ngāūranga) and proceeded even though they had no authority to sell Te Aro. Local Te Aro Pā leaders denounced the sale as fraudulent and refused to vacate their land. Wakefield, in an attempt to justify his actions, dismissively labeled Te Aro Pā a “slave pā,” implying its occupants had lesser claim to the soil. Tensions ran high as colonial surveyors arrived to impose a British grid over a landscape woven with Māori significance. Armed with swords and pistols, the survey teams met covert resistance: Te Aro Māori pulled out survey pegs under cover of night to thwart the surveying of their village. The standoff over Te Aro Pā exemplified the wider struggle for land in Wellington. Governor FitzRoy tried to entice the pā’s inhabitants to relocate by offering £300, but they resisted selling their ancestral home. It was not until 1847, under Governor Grey, that a compromised eviction was achieved: Te Aro Pā people agreed to move in exchange for a 526-acre block elsewhere plus material compensation (two horses, two carts, and two steel mills). This deal effectively emptied the pā from its strategic location in the heart of the growing town.

Colonial Wellington expanded rapidly over the former pā site, but the legacy of displacement endured. In the ensuing decades, piece by piece the hapū (subtribes) lost nearly all their land in the Te Whanganui-a-Tara (Wellington) area. By the 1870s Te Aro Pā had been entirely abandoned as a Māori village – its people either forced to join relatives in outlying regions like the Hutt Valley or relegated to marginal lands. One group of Te Aro Pā survivors, comprised of Ngāti Ruanui and Taranaki whānau, was allocated land at Wellington’s outskirts, but this too was a cruel blow. The land was near a landfill and chemically contaminated, making it virtually uninhabitable. Over time most of the original Te Aro land was sold off to settlers or the Crown, erasing physical traces of the pā. Yet Māori never relinquished their spiritual connection. Even in the absence of visible marae or kainga, the whenua itself holds memory and meaning. Recent archaeological discoveries – such as the uncovering of traditional whare foundations beneath an inner-city apartment building in 2005 – have given modern Wellingtonians a glimpse of that nearly forgotten past. The preserved remains under glass now serve as what Heritage New Zealand describes as a “spiritual, emotional and tangible connection” to the ancestors (tūpuna) who once lived on this land. In a very real sense, the struggle for whenua at Te Aro Pā laid the foundation for all subsequent layers of history at the site: it is the mātauranga (indigenous knowledge) and memory of this land that later events would stir, and which the people – especially tangata whenua (local Māori) – would continue to honor and defend.

Bethune & Hunter: The Exchange Building and Colonial Power

Where Māori communal life once flourished, the colonial town of Wellington rose rapidly in the mid-19th century – and with it emerged new centers of economic and civic power. Among the earliest and most emblematic of these was the premises of Bethune & Hunter, a firm of merchant traders whose building stood near the Wellington waterfront. Founded around 1840 by two Scottish settlers, Kenneth Bethune (1812–1855) and George Hunter (1821–1880), the firm quickly entrenched itself in the young settlement’s commercial life. Their original wooden warehouse was erected in 1841–42 on what was then shoreline (now Bond Street) and, tellingly, it served as Wellington’s first Custom House – the official depot for bonded goods. In its halls, early civic milestones took place; for instance, the building hosted the fledgling community’s first meeting to discuss establishing St. Mark’s Church. This dual role as mercantile hub and civic gathering place made the Bethune & Hunter building a potent symbol of colonial authority. The structure itself – a sturdy warehouse and counting-house – physically dominated its corner and stood out amidst the makeshift timber cottages of early Wellington. It represented the imposition of a new economic order on Te Aro: a European “Exchange” where trade, property deals, and municipal decisions intermingled, often to the exclusion of the very people who first occupied the land.

The careers of the firm’s principals illustrate how commerce and governance intertwined in colonial power structures. George Hunter, for example, not only co-ran the trading company but also became Wellington’s first Mayor in 1842. Known as a “storekeeper-general” of the settlement, Hunter leveraged his mercantile success into political influence, embodying the settler elite’s rise. His partnership with Bethune supplied everything from foodstuffs to building materials to the growing colony, effectively controlling crucial aspects of the local economy. In these early decades, businesses like Bethune & Hunter’s also engaged in land transactions and development. Auction houses associated with the firm were involved in selling town acres and rural lots to settlers, facilitating the transfer of Māori land into European hands as Wellington expanded. The firm’s role as agents and auctioneers for real estate meant they stood to profit from the colonial urban boom and the subdivision of land that had recently belonged to mana whenua. Indeed, by the late 19th century George Hunter’s family had acquired extensive real-estate holdings in Wellington, underscoring how colonial commerce and land ownership went hand in hand.

The Bethune & Hunter building itself became a landmark and a lasting monument to the colony’s formative years. Constructed just after the 1840 Treaty of Waitangi signing, it survived into the 20th century, weathering earthquakes and the city’s transformation around it. By 1958, the venerable warehouse (then over 115 years old) was celebrated as Wellington’s oldest surviving business premises – a rare physical link back to the 1840s. Its long survival, however, ended in controversy. That year the Wellington City Council decided to demolish the aging structure in order to build a modern car park on the site, seeing more value in parking spaces for a motorized city than in preserving a relic of colonial history. The planned destruction of Bethune & Hunter’s building sparked public outcry. Newly formed heritage advocates (the forerunner of today’s Historic Places Trust) protested the loss, marking one of Wellington’s first organized heritage preservation campaigns. Despite these efforts, the old exchange building was torn down and replaced by the concrete ramps of the Lombard Street carpark. The episode was emblematic: a seat of colonial economic power was literally bulldozed to make way for “progress,” yet in the process it awakened a community desire to honor the past. The memory of Bethune & Hunter’s Exchange lives on in historical accounts and photographs, reminding us how that modest wooden building once orchestrated the flow of goods, wealth, and influence in early Wellington. It stood as a conduit between worlds – Māori and Pākehā, pre-capitalist and capitalist – even as its existence depended on the dispossession of the former and the dominance of the latter. In this way, the story of Bethune & Hunter is inseparable from the story of colonization in Te Aro: it is a story of commerce, colonal civic order, and contested land underlying the modern cityscape.

The Battle of Manners Street: A Clash of Cultures and Racial Power

In 1943, a little over a century after the upheavals of Wellington’s founding, the streets of Te Aro would again become a battleground – this time not over land surveys or deeds, but over culture, race, and wartime power dynamics. The so-called “Battle of Manners Street” was an infamous riot that erupted on the evening of April 3, 1943, amidst the pressures of World War II. Wellington at that time was host to tens of thousands of American servicemen, most en route to fight in the Pacific. The influx of U.S. Marines and soldiers, stationed in camps around the city, had a profound social impact on the local population. Downtown establishments, particularly the Allied Services Club on Manners Street, became common mixing grounds for American troops, New Zealand servicemen, and civilians. It was outside this club – just a few blocks from the old Bethune & Hunter site – that tensions boiled over. Around 6 p.m., as pubs closed for the mandated “six o’clock swill,” intoxicated patrons spilled into Manners Street. A brawl broke out between groups of American G.I.s and New Zealanders (both Māori and Pākehā) congregating near the club. What began as a scuffle quickly escalated into a running street fight that spread onto nearby Cuba and Willis Streets, eventually involving hundreds of people and lasting several hours.

At the heart of the conflict were underlying cultural frictions and racial attitudes. Many New Zealand onlookers and later historians noted that American racial segregation practices collided with New Zealand’s relative racial integration. U.S. military units at the time were segregated by race, and white American MPs from the Jim Crow South were reportedly uneasy seeing Māori soldiers socialising alongside white troops and local women. One eyewitness account and subsequent retellings suggest that on that night, some white American servicemen attempted to bar Māori servicemen from entering the Allied Services Club, asserting a whites-only rule that might have been common in their hometowns. This did not sit well with the New Zealanders present – both Māori and Pākehā. Kiwi soldiers and locals stood up for their Māori comrades, insisting on their equal right to enter. A tense standoff ensued until an American threw the first punch. According to reports, the Americans took off their belts to use as weapons and a mass melee erupted when New Zealand soldiers (of both races) rushed to support the Māori who had been excluded. The violence drew in more and more participants: by some estimates over 1,000 servicemen and civilians were embroiled in fistfights that rolled through the city center. Witnesses recall chaotic scenes of cheering crowds surrounding brawling men, and U.S. Shore Patrol officers wielding batons as they tried to break up fights and haul their men into trucks.

Multiple factors fed this spontaneous combustion. Wartime social conditions provided kindling: Wellington was a city full of young men under stress, competition and resentment simmered. The presence of well-paid, confident American troops had already led to local anxieties about an “American invasion” of New Zealand society. American G.I.s were famously flush with dollars and charisma, and many struck up relationships with local women, causing envy among some New Zealand men. Add alcohol and the strict 6 p.m. pub closing, and brawls were perhaps inevitable. But the racial dimension made the Manners Street riot particularly significant. U.S. colonial ideology regarding race (which placed white Americans above people of color) clashed with New Zealand’s self-image of racial equality under the Crown, however imperfect that equality was in practice. The New Zealand Government had even issued a pamphlet to U.S. forces reminding them that Māori and Pākehā enjoyed equal status in NZ society. Tellingly, a confidential memo at the time advised New Zealanders to “be friendly and sympathetic” to Black American troops but also noted these troops were “not accustomed…to close relationships with white people” – instructing locals to carefully manage mixed gatherings. In short, everyone knew that American racial segregation norms were a potential powder keg. That keg exploded on Manners Street.

The aftermath of the riot was swiftly, even somewhat suspiciously, downplayed by authorities. Fearing damage to Allied unity and morale, officials suppressed news of the fracas; newspapers largely censored or minimized the story. The Police Commissioner at the time described it as nothing more than “a bit of a skirmish” by a small crowd, claiming no one was seriously hurt. Only a couple of arrests were reported, and no American servicemen were charged. This official narrative starkly contradicted the vivid public lore that grew around the event – tales of two American fatalities (unconfirmed) and a spontaneous Kiwi uprising against racist bullying. Recent historians have tried to sort fact from myth and suggest the riot’s scale and racial motivation may have been exaggerated in recollection, possibly conflated with other fights that month. Indeed, similar brawls between Americans and locals occurred in Auckland and even overseas (such as the Battle of Bamber Bridge in England) during that era. Nonetheless, the Battle of Manners Street has taken on legendary status as a clash of cultures on New Zealand soil. It was a moment when ordinary Wellingtonians – Māori and Pākehā together – literally fought side by side to assert a principle of racial equality and local sovereignty (at least on the street corner) against what they perceived as American arrogance. And significantly, it happened in Te Aro, on ground that had already seen struggles over indigenous rights and colonial power. In a symbolic sense, the riot was a continuation of the story of that ground: a fight over who would have mana (authority and respect) in that space – a question that had first been contested when Te Aro Pā confronted the New Zealand Company a century before. The proximity of the 1943 clash to the “Carpark” site lends a poetic continuity to the history: the spirits of place had witnessed injustice before, and on that night they witnessed a brief, chaotic reclamation of respect by the descendants of the displaced.

Cultural and Spiritual Continuum: The Carpark’s Power

Today, the unassuming car park in the Te Aro district – layered in asphalt and concrete, frequented by hurried commuters and shoppers – might not outwardly advertise its profound historical significance. Yet to those who know or feel its past, this site emanates a unique cultural and spiritual energy. It is as if the many events imprinted on this whenua have never truly faded, but continue to resonate in the present. Māori custodians and empathetic locals sometimes speak of certain urban locations as having a strong wairua (spirit) – a presence that can be sensed, especially when one knows the kōrero (stories) of what transpired there. The Carpark at Te Aro is one such place. Beneath its concrete lies the soil of Te Aro Pā, with all the mana and memory of the iwi who lived and died there. Adjacent to it are the ghosts of colonial commerce – the likes of Bethune & Hunter’s Exchange that once buzzed with settlers making deals – and just down the road echoes the din of the 1943 riot where Māori stood up against foreign prejudice. These layered histories contribute to what some might call the mauri (life-force) of the site. Rather than being erased by time, the trauma and triumph embedded in the land have, in Māori understanding, made it tapu (sacred, or marked off) in a way that modern structures cannot mute. Indeed, Heritage New Zealand has acknowledged that even fragmentary remains of Te Aro Pā constitute a “spiritual, emotional and ... tangible connection” to the ancestors – a statement that applies not only to artifacts under glass but to the very ground of Te Aro.

For the community of “Watchers” – those who are cognisant of the Carpark’s deeper meaning – the site is not empty; it is occupied by memory and guardianship. In Māori tradition, ancestral spirits often take on the role of kaitiaki, or guardians, who watch over their descendants and protect sacred places (wāhi tapu). One can imagine the tūpuna of Te Aro Pā as kaitiaki in the spiritual realm, their eyes ever upon this spot that was once their home. In the human realm, the role of kaitiaki is taken up by people who refuse to let the past be forgotten. These are the “Watchers” – perhaps iwi elders, local historians, artists, or activists – who keep vigil in their own ways. They may not literally stand guard at the Carpark 24/7, but through acts of remembrance and ritual they assert indigenous presence and sovereignty. For instance, descendants of Te Aro’s original inhabitants have been known to return and perform karakia (prayers) or lay down symbolic markers of whakapapa (genealogy) to reconnect the site to its Māori heritage. Every such ceremony or even informal acknowledgment is a form of ritual reclamation. It is a quiet statement that, despite the layers of pavement and colonial brick, this ground is still Maori ground – ko te whenua, ko mātou (the land is us, and we are the land).

Furthermore, the concept of surveillance in this context carries a profound twist. Where once colonial authorities surveyed Māori land for appropriation, and where modern CCTV cameras now surveil parked cars, the Watchers turn surveillance into a form of reverence and resistance. They “watch over” the site not to control, but to care. By maintaining a watchful eye, they ensure that new developments or city plans do not further desecrate what lies beneath. This community vigilance was seen in the 2000s when developers uncovered remains of Te Aro Pā – local iwi and heritage experts intervened to protect and honor the findings, leading to the creation of a small interpretive center rather than simply allowing construction to proceed unchecked. In a similar way, any proposal that might affect the Carpark’s subterranean history would likely be met with organized scrutiny. Such watchfulness is a facet of mana whenua – the authority of the people of the land to have a say in how that land is treated. Even if legal ownership was wrested away long ago, morally the descendants of Te Aro have never ceded their kaitiakitanga. As one Waitangi Tribunal report noted, Wellington Māori were *“deprived of 120,000 acres of land which they never consented to surrender”*. This recognition bolsters calls for respecting sites like Te Aro, where the injustice of that dispossession is most keenly felt and where efforts at cultural redress can be focused.

In recent times, art and design have also been employed as forms of remembrance at the Carpark and its vicinity. A notable example is the adjacent Te Aro Park (formerly Pigeon Park), redesigned in the 1980s with Māori motifs and sculptures that evoke the waves of the sea and the patterns of tukutuku panels. The park’s very name and creative layout are an homage to the Te Aro Pā that once occupied that space, symbolically “reinstating the significance of Te Aro as a major Māori stronghold”. Through such aesthetic interventions, the cityscape itself becomes a canvas of memory – a visible reminder to all passersby of what once was here. Each pattern, each plaque or pou (carved post) near the Carpark tells part of the story, rewarding those watchers who look closely. Meanwhile, the Carpark’s existence – a utilitarian structure born from the demolition of Wellington’s oldest building – stands as a cautionary marker of how colonial progress can both bury and inadvertently reveal history. The fact that a parking building replaced Bethune & Hunter’s warehouse in 1958, despite public protest, is not lost on the Watchers. It underscores the importance of their role: to guard against the erasure of the past in the name of progress, and to assert that what may seem like just another city lot is actually a sacred palimpsest of cultures.

In conclusion, the power of the Carpark site lies in this unbroken continuum of struggle, memory, and spiritual presence. From the first Māori-Pākehā encounters over land at Te Aro Pā, to the mercantile dominance of the Exchange Building, to the multicultural melee of the Battle of Manners Street, and finally to the ongoing efforts of the Watchers to honor and reclaim the space – each layer adds to the mana of the place. An academic lens reveals the complex historical patterns of colonization, conflict, and adaptation; a cultural-spiritual lens reveals that those patterns are not merely of the past but are alive in the landscape today. The Watchers, blending rigorous historical knowledge with respect for wairua, ensure that the Carpark is remembered as more than just a slab of asphalt. It is a site of conscience and continuity, where the aspirations of indigenous sovereignty and the lessons of history converge. In the end, the Carpark in Wellington is a modern-day marae of sorts: a space where narratives meet, where the seen and unseen coexist, and where the act of watching – of bearing witness – becomes an act of healing and empowerment for the community.
