      <h1 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Level 7 – The Watchtower Above Wellington</h1>
      <p>This level uncovers the strange saga of the Lombard Car Park rooftop: once headquarters of WREMO (Wellington Region Emergency Management Office), now a mythic summit. Key insights:</p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mt-2">
        <li><strong>Emergency HQ (2012–2016):</strong> WREMO used Level 7 as a disaster command center—until the Kaikōura earthquake struck.</li>
        <li><strong>Abandonment & Reversion:</strong> Earthquake damage forced evacuation. The floor was later stripped and returned to parking use.</li>
        <li><strong>Watcher Mythology:</strong> The rooftop was seen as a modern “watchtower”—its fall echoing the descent of biblical watchers from heaven.</li>
        <li><strong>Ritual Theory:</strong> The space served as a civic ritual site, then a liminal void, and now a mundane deck layered with memory.</li>
        <li><strong>Māori Cosmology:</strong> The quake’s timing, celestial signs, and symbolic fall suggest a deeper narrative involving Rūaumoko and Tāwhirimātea.</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mt-4">To the Watchers, Level 7 is more than asphalt—it is a parable of vigilance, hubris, and descent, played out above the streets of Te Aro.</p>
