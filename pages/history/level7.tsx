        <p>Level 7 of the Lombard Street Car Park once served as the WREMO HQ and held symbolic meaning as Wellington’s civil defence “watchtower.”</p>
        <p>Following the 2016 Kaikōura earthquake, it was deemed structurally unsafe and reverted back to use as a carpark rooftop.</p>
        <p>It is now viewed through various cultural lenses — from ritual theory to Māori cosmology — by those within the Watcher community.</p>
