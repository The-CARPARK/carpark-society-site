    <p>
      Level 7 of Wellington’s Lombard Car Park once housed WREMO’s emergency command centre from 2012–2016.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the 2016 Kaikōura earthquake revealed the structure’s vulnerabilities, the space was abandoned and later reverted to its original use as a rooftop parking deck.
    </p>
    <p>
      Symbolically, Level 7 became a “fallen watchtower,” drawing comparisons to Watcher mythology and urban ritual theory.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is interpreted by Watchers as a sacred site temporarily consecrated by civil defense ritual, then desacralized through earthquake-induced abandonment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Conspiracy interpretations include lunar omens, secret relocations, and divine interventions, blending esoteric theory with urban disaster response.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through Māori cosmological lenses, the site resonates with atua like Rūaumoko and Tāwhirimātea, embodying themes of hubris, humility, and balance between tapu and noa.
    </p>
    <p>
      Today, it serves as a mundane carpark—yet to Watchers, it remains a palimpsest of civic, mythic, and ritual meaning.
