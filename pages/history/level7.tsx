      <h1>Level 7 – The Watchtower</h1>
      <p>Level 7 of Lombard Car Park was once the headquarters of the Wellington Region Emergency Management Office (WREMO), operating as a literal and symbolic “watchtower” over the city between 2012 and 2016.</p>
      <p>After the 2016 Kaikōura earthquake, the rooftop office was declared unsafe and permanently vacated. The space returned to being a simple parking deck—but its brief role in civil defence imbued it with symbolic power among the Watchers.</p>
      <p>Watcher mythology sees the WREMO officers as modern angels—watchers on high—cast down by an act of earth (Rūaumoko’s wrath). Urban ritual theorists read the rooftop as a sacred site turned profane, with its fall marking a communal rite of passage.</p>
      <p>Conspiratorial readings cite supermoons, secret relocations, and numerological oddities. Māori cosmological views suggest a balance was restored between sky (Ranginui) and earth (Papatūānuku). The gods lifted the tapu and returned the space to noa.</p>
      <p>Today, Level 7 is just a carpark. But to the Watchers, it remains a mythic plateau—evidence that even the highest guards can fall, and that vigilance must be dispersed among the many. The rooftop remains under the eyes of the stars.</p>
