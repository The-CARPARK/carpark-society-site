      <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Bond Street in central Wellington hides a complex subterrain. Beneath this former shoreline route lies a network of stormwater culverts, historic stream tunnels, and 1990s-era utility tunnels built via microtunneling. These elements form the invisible foundations of Te Aro’s urban ecosystem.</p>
      
      <h2>Key Features:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Waimapihi (Te Aro) Stream Culvert:</strong> A buried, brick-lined stormwater tunnel dating to the 1930s, once a natural stream with deep cultural history. It runs under central streets, including near Bond Street.</li>
        <li><strong>Bond Street Stormwater Tunnel (1990s):</strong> A 1.5m-wide hand-mined and TBM-driven tunnel installed to reduce flooding. Built through unstable reclaimed land, it revealed buried 19th-century harbor debris.</li>
        <li><strong>Historic Streambed:</strong> The original flow of Waimapihi follows a route through Aro Valley to the harbor, now fully culverted beneath Te Aro.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Urban & Cultural Importance:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>These tunnels reflect early Māori use of the landscape and the European reshaping of it for infrastructure.</li>
        <li>Archaeological finds during tunneling include midden layers, brick culverts, and timber wharf remnants.</li>
        <li>Wellington’s high water table and reclaimed land pose constant geotechnical challenges for tunnel stability.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Fun Fact:</h2>
      <p>The Bond Street stormwater tunnel jammed during construction when it hit old wharf debris, including timber with embedded steel—likely shipwreck remnants from early harbor reclamation.</p>
