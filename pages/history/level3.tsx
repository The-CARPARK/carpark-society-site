      <p>
        Bond Street in Wellington's Te Aro district conceals a complex network of underground tunnels. These include
        stormwater culverts, particularly the brick-lined Te Aro Culvert that carries the historic Waimapihi Stream.
        Installed in the 1930s, this ovoid brick tunnel stretches beneath much of central Wellington, serving as
        a critical component of the city's stormwater system. Its route runs below or near Bond Street, linking it
        to the larger urban hydrological network.

        In the 1990s, a major stormwater tunnel was constructed directly beneath Bond Street using hand-excavation
        and pipe-jacking due to fragile reclaimed soils. This large concrete tunnel was part of a microtunneling
        upgrade and encountered remnants of old harbor infrastructure – timbers, wharf piles, and buried debris.
        These discoveries confirmed the historical complexity of the subsoil and revealed layers of urban archaeology.

        Additionally, utility ducts for telecom and electricity run below the street, though these are not
        human-accessible tunnels. Wastewater pipes also traverse the area, but major sewer tunnels lie closer
        to the waterfront. Historical records suggest no wartime bunkers under Bond Street, but nearby sites
        such as Mt Cook held civil defence shelters during WWII.

        The buried Waimapihi Stream remains the most culturally significant tunnel – named after the ancestress
        Māpihi and still active as a stormwater conduit. The city continues to maintain these subterranean
        features while public art, such as the Garrett Street mural, helps raise awareness of the hidden
        waterways beneath our feet.
